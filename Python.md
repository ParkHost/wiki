# Overview
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.

# PIP
Pip is the python tooling to install (external) libraries/modules into your projects 

PIP can be installed while install the python engine.
You can also [install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) it separately

# PyPi
Find, install and publish Python packages with the Python Package Index

Here you can find all published Python Libraries / Modules / Packages
https://pypi.org/

# Virtual Environments
With a Python Virtual Environment you only install the dependencies  in the project itself and not globally (system wide))

```bash
# pip         = command
# -m (switch) = Module
# first venv  = Module name
# second venv = Name of your Virtual Environment
pip -m venv venv
```
