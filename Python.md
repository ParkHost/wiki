Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.
Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write:
clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

# Virtual Environments
With a Python Virtual Environment you only install the dependencies  in the project itself and not globally (system wide))

```bash
# pip         = command
# -m (switch) = Module
# first venv  = Module name
# second venv = Name of your Virtual Environment
pip -m venv venv
```
