## Some fine High Order Functions with a 'iffy' smell;
```JavaScript
// Gets every 'Entry' out of the Object();
// In a Object you have { Key: Value }, 'Entry' means you get both in 1 array [Key: Value]
const Object.Entries = New Object().Object.Entries($allEntries)
```
---

```JS
// Reduce; counts every element in the array with his previos count;
const Reduce = New Array().Reduce(count, [array, ]) 
```
