## Some fine High Order Functions with a 'iffy' smell;
```JavaScript
// Get's every 'Entry' out of the Object();
// In a Object you have { Key: Value } and 'Entry' you get both in 1 array [Key: Value]
const Object.Entries = New Object().Object.Entries($allEntries)
```
---

```JS
// Reduce counts every element in the array with his previos count;
// With this you can get the total 'counts' in a array
const Reduce = New Array().Reduce(count, [array, ]) 
```
