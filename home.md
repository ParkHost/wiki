This website means nothing to the most of you.
I like to create things of my own even if it is meaningless.
If you (dis)like an `article`, you are free to leave a comment.

In this evolution of digital time, we all need to know what is keeping us occupied every single day...

## I like to code in Javascript
JavaScript is written as  a dynamic language ('it has some logic under the hood'),
It makes some things slower but fast webapp build as opposite.
Every browser supports JavaScript and is accessible through every device these days.
We can use the same language on the client (browser / electron), the server side (Node / Deno) as well as the exchange data (JSON = JavaScript Object Notation).

I like to create things with just some `knowledge` and my `mind`.
