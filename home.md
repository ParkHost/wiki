This website means nothing to the most of you.
I like to create things of my own even if it is meaningless.
If you (dis)like an `article`, you are free to leave a comment.

In this digital-evolution, we all need to know what is keeping us busy every single day...

**Code let you create things with just some `knowledge` and your `mind`. Solve puzzles and how you going to connect the dots.
I'm passionate about infrastructure (where and how do you run your code and why?).
Things like Docker / CI/CD and Kubernetes got my attention lately**
