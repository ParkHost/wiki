One endpoint to handle all your OAuth authentications,
with different kind of (custom) providers.

# Story
Single Sign On is de-facto standard in the IT industry, every app needs to be connected with the same provider, this creates a seamless user experience, which will use the same account in all applications.

What if you build an app that needs to be used by different kind of customers which each its own OAuth Provider, how would you handle the authentication flows?

> **Exactly; you can use the OAuth Proxy of Parkhost.eu**
